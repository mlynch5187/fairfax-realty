## Fairfax Realty App

### Objectives

- The application should have a section displaying current and sold listings
- Integrate a calendar booking tool to easily allow a prospective client to set up a consultation session
- Add an about me page, along with a section with some testimonials

In order to best meet these objectives I will begin by using Miro to whiteboard the outline of what the site will look like visually.
After a proper app design has been created, I will use the Github project board to make user stories for each feature.

One learning objective is to refresh my memory when it comes to adding a booking calendar to a website. I have done so with calendly,
so I may use that tool again, or I may be steered towards another tool like YouCanBookMe after doing a bit of research. Another
learning objective is to practice Ruby with the Rails framework along with database management.

### What Is It?
This application is a platform for a realtor to showcase and market themselves. On this app a user can find contact information,
easily book consultations, and view the realtor's current and former listings.
